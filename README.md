## App Description:

 Approach is your one stop shop to finding another golfers in your area to play a round with. Have you or a friend ever wanted to go play golf and have no one to play with? It can be intimidating and anxiety ridden to go to a course for the first time and play by yourself. With Approach you are able to find other members of your golf course and even join a cllub where you and fellow amateurs can go try and pretend to know what you're doing on the golf course. It's a lot easier to perform "under par" with people in your group.
